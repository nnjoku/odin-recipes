    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <!-- ordered list -->
      <li>
        First, make the tomato-based sauce by blending together the red bell
        peppers, tomatoes, onion, and scotch bonnet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the cooking oil in a large pan over medium heat, then add the diced
        onions and let them cook for about 3 minutes or until they are soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then stir in
        garlic, ginger, and bay leaves—leave to cook for 2 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the blended sauce and allow the pepper to cook until the water is
        reduced and the sauce become thick —about 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with thyme, curry powder, bouillon cubes, salt, and pepper to
        taste. Cook for another 2 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rinsed rice to the sauce and stir until it is well coated with
        the sauce. Then add the chicken stock, stir briefly, cover with a
        tight-fitting lid, and bring to a quick boil over high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat
        immediately to low and steam until the rice is done—about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the butter, sliced tomato, and onions, stir together briefly and
        turn off the heat. <br />
        Cover it immediately so that the heat remaining in the rice can steam up
        the vegetables a little.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with sweet fried plantains, roasted chicken, or salad.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Remove the bay leaves once the rice is done. <br />
        However, if you cannot find it, do not be tempted to dig through it
        since over-stirring will cause the rice to break. <br />
        Just leave it and remove it whenever you find it.
      </li>
    </ul>
